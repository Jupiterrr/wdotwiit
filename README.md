What is all this stuff about?
========

I am a stupid student who forgets about space and time all the time, so I created this website (http://what-day-is.it/).
It is a **very** simple website, that tells you the day of the week :-)

The site uses the time of your computer as well as your IP-based location to determine the current day.

- create your own, name it after the [ISO 639-1](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1#ISO_639-1)
- make a [pullrequest](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
